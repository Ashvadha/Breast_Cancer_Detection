# Breast_Cancer_Detection

In this project, I developed a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect breast cancer from medical images. Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women worldwide, and early detection is key to improving patient outcomes. CNNs are a type of deep learning model that can learn to recognize patterns and features in images, making them well-suited for medical image analysis.

To train and evaluate the model, I used a dataset of mammogram images from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM). I preprocessed the data by resizing and normalizing the images and split the dataset into training and testing sets. I then trained the CNN model on the training set and evaluated its performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

The results of the project demonstrated the potential of deep learning models for breast cancer detection from medical images, with the CNN model achieving high accuracy and performance on the testing set. The project has important implications for improving the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis, and can serve as a starting point for further research in the field of medical image analysis using deep learning.
